## ZHANG LAB Statement

The mission of the Center for Intelligent Infrastructure (CII) is to advance knowledge and education in the areas of sustainability, adaptivity, and autonomy of infrastructure systems. The center supports interdisciplinary research programs that integrate advanced theories and engineering principles in the areas of materials, construction, resiliency, sensing, control, optimization, communication, machine learning and artificial intelligence. The ultimate goal of CII is to be the definitive national focal point for academic, industrial, and federal agencies to collaborate and translate scientific discoveries into commercial applications of high societal impact. It will also serve as a basis for education across different areas related to intelligent infrastructure.
